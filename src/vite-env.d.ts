// The file vite-env.d.ts is a TypeScript declaration file automatically generated for Vite projects. Its purpose is to provide type definitions for Vite-specific features and global types, ensuring TypeScript understands Vite's environment variables and client-side imports.


// tells TypeScript to include type definitions from Vite, which helps with type checking and autocompletion for Vite-specific globals (like import.meta.env). This file is important for TypeScript projects using Vite, but is not needed in plain JavaScript projects.
